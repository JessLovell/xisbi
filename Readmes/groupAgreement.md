# XISBI Group Agreement
## Communication plan
- Everyone gets to say something on a subject. 
- Before stand-up we meet and discuss what issues/bugs we have. Then in stand-up we can discuss them at a higher level.  
- We’ll create a safe space by respecting each other’s opinions and views. 

## Conflict plan 
- When there is a conflict, the two people will discuss it, if no resolution comes from that, then bring it to the whole team where we decide as a group as how to compromise and move forward. 
- Take time to consider and disconnect from the tension and take a walk or something.
- Always assume others have good intentions. 

## Work plan
- We’re planning to use Github Issues to assign tasks. 
- Each morning we will decide who gets to work on each task (on volunteer basis). 
- The goal is to get everyone to be involved in each part of it. 
- Dave will be the head of getting Github issues worked out. 
- Pair Programming for day 1. 

## Git process 
- Nobody merges their own PR. The other pair needs to review and merge PR. 
- Have a development branch the everyone pulls from, then merge to development branch. When features are completed merge to master. 
- Master should have benchmarks: 
  - Test of life on heroku, home page, users complete, MVP, features as completed. 
- Other: 
  - Work Schedule: 
      - Everyone starts at 9am

  - Ask for help after 15 minutes. **Be receptive for help.**
